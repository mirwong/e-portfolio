# Research Project on Ocean Iron Fertilization
### *(2017-2018)*

Ocean iron fertilization is XXXXXX

I worked with Professor K. Coale at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories to research the feasibility of ocean iron fertilization (a biogeochemical method of carbon sequestration) at potential high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions of the ocean. This involved researching various biogeochemical cycles and their effect on iron fertilization, learning new software, and analyzing measured data. Ultimately, this research resulted in an academic publication.
